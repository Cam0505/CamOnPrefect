# H
{% docs humidity %}
    The relative humidity of the air at a given location, measured as a percentage (%). High humidity levels can affect comfort and play a role in weather events like precipitation.
{% enddocs %}
# I
# J
# K
# L
{% docs latitude %}
The latitude coordinate of the city in decimal degrees. Positive values indicate locations north of the equator.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs longitude %}

{% enddocs %}
# M
# N
# O
{% docs ozone %}
    The concentration of ozone in the atmosphere, typically measured in Dobson Units (DU). Ozone plays a key role in absorbing UV radiation, and its concentration can influence the level of UV exposure.
{% enddocs %}
# P
{% docs precipitation_sum %}
    The total amount of precipitation (rain, snow, etc.) that has fallen over a given period, measured in millimeters (mm) or inches (in). This value helps to track overall rainfall or snowfall accumulation, which is important for understanding seasonal or long-term trends in precipitation.
{% enddocs %}

# Q
# R
{% docs region %}
    A higher-level geographic grouping, such as a continent or internal administrative region. Optional but useful for rollups and segmentation.
{% enddocs %}
# S
{% docs sunshine_duration %}
    The total duration of sunshine at a given location over a specific period, typically measured in hours. This metric is important for assessing how much sunlight an area receives, which can affect agriculture, energy production, and climate conditions.
{% enddocs %}
# T
{% docs temperature_mean %}
    The mean temperature at a given location, averaged over a specific period (e.g., daily, weekly). This value helps in assessing general weather conditions and trends over time, providing a more stable representation of temperature compared to single-point measurements.
{% enddocs %}
